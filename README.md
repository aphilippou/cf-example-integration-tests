# Welcome

So, you've decided to try Codefresh? Welcome on board!

Using this repository we'll help you get up to speed with basic functionality such as: *compiling*, *testing* and *building Docker images*.

This project uses `Node Js` to build an application which will eventually become a distributable Docker image.

## Looking around

In the root of this repository you'll find a file named `codefresh.yml`, this is our [build descriptor](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml) and it describes the different steps that comprise our process.
Let's quickly review the contents of this file:

### Compiling and testing

To compile and test our code we use Codefresh's [Freestyle step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-freestyle).

The Freestyle step basically let's you say "Hey, Codefresh! Here's a Docker image. Create a new container and run these commands for me, will ya?"

```yml
integration_test:
      type: composition
      composition:
          db:
            image: postgres
      composition_candidates:
        test:
          image: ${{build_prj}}
          command: npm test
```

The `image` field states which image should be used when creating the container (Similar to Travis CI's `language` or circleci`s `machine`).

The `commands` field is how you specify all the commands that you'd like to execute

### Building

To bake our application into a Docker image we use Codefresh's [Build step](https://docs.codefresh.io/docs/steps#section-build).

The Build is a simplified abstraction over the Docker build command.

```yml
build_prj:
    type: build
    description: UC - build step
    image_name: codefreshio/yaml-example-integration-test
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tag: ${{CF_BRANCH}}
```

Use the `image_name` field to declare the name of the resulting image (don't forget to change the image owner name from `codefreshdemo` to your own!).

## Using This Example

To use this example:

* Fork this repository to your own [INSERT_SCM_SYSTEM (git, bitbucket)] account.
* Log in to Codefresh using your [INSERT_SCM_SYSTEM (git, bitbucket)] account.
* Click the `Add Service` button.
* Select the forked repository.
* Select the `I have a Codefresh.yml file` option.
* Complete the wizard.
* Rejoice!
